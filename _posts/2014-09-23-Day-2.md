Week 2-This is your brain….This is your brain on Javascript

Wow, what a week!

This week has bee focused on learning JavaScript and I feel like I’ve been on a roller coaster that just won’t slow down. This was definately not a “taste” of Javascript programming language but more like an indigestible chunk to be swallowed in one instance.

The project that we were to produce by Monday seemed nearly impossible since I am still struggling with really KNOWING the Javascript language. I’ve put in at least 18 hours per day in trying to become comfortable with writing JS but I’m still not where I want to be. I won’t let JS win and I will continue to work on embedding this language in my head….  

My weeks struggle: I can say in english what I want Javascript to do but feel limited when I want to write it in Javascript. I’m starting to think that this may be something people are “born with” being able to comprehend these complex things….and starting to doubt my ability on ever learning this language.

Lesson learned: Don’t doubt myself. If I don’t think I can then how can I expect others to have faith in me? The determination that I have in my heart and the persistence I have for my work, this too shall overcome. I WILL become a creative problem solver- - both visually and analytical.
