TIR Day 2

Today I learned about creating git pages to use as a professional site for blogging about my Iron Yard expereince! The page generator was a great start
to not having a completely blank site BUT the designer in me really wanted to install a theme. I spent some time researching themes
and desided to go along with a specific one that in the long run gave me issue. WHY? Because the particular theme I wanted required all this additonal 
"things" to be installed. It was a learning experience as I learned that the "things" that needed to be installed were
called "gems" and this comes in relation with ruby so from my failed attempts I was able to learn 
the these "gems" are like libraries that need to be installed to run certain tasks.
I practiced alot of git commands but unfortunatley spend most of my time figuring the theme installation
process which overall was a bad way to get stuck.

My "take-away" : Don't get caught up in getting clean code in the termianal that shows not errors right away.
Also, don't trust anything that says "simple installation".
