TIR Day 5

I made it through week one! It sure feels longer than one week with all the material that I've learned. It was a fast pace and a bit
stressful but at the end of the week I felt more comfortable about what I've learned. I have a good understanding of the work flow and 
up to date on the assignments. My goal is to not spend too much time jumping ahead on subjects but to really grasp what I've learned so
far and build upon that. On that note, the rest of this weekends goal is to spend time on tutorials and repeat, repeat, repeat what 
was done for practice.

My "take-away" : Balance your time and focus. Don't be SO hard on yourself -- You are here to LEARN. I spent time stressing about not knowing things right away for no reason. In the end 
I was able to understand and be comfortable with the "distributed revision control and source code management" we use better known as
"Github".
