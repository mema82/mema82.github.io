TIR Day 6

Monday, September 29th, 2014, The day that will go down in history as having me rethink
my whole life -aka- Learning Javascript. This was definately not an "taste" of the javascript programming 
language but more of like an undigestable chunk to be swollowed in on instance. I afraid of whats to be expected
from us with this language. Afraid...very afraid.
