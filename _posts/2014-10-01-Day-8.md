TIR Day 8

I'm still fighting with JS, particularly on this assignment where I can't seem to express whats in my head. I feel as if I understand the 
language and what it is doing but can't write it myself because the structure is all jumbled up in my head. I find it difficult especially 
for the fact that I am more of a visual problem solver than an analytical problem solver and it hurts just the same way as if you go to the 
gym, everyday for 15-18 hours and work ONLY that one muscle... I understand this but have an issue accepting it becuase I know with my 
determination that I have in my heart and the persistence I have for my work, this too shall overcome. 
I WILL become a creative problem solver-- both visually and analytical.
