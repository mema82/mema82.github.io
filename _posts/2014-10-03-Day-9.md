TIR Day 10

I'll be here all weekend folks! I learned an important lesson today pushing assignments to the incorrect branch on github. I finished my 
work late last night and was in a rush to push it up that I pushed to the wrong branch. I spent a good portion cleaning up my git hub
branches to ensure that all was where it should be. I have a long checklist this weekend which includes correcting my past assignments 
as well as re-doing tutorials and re-reading my notes so I can have a better understanding of JS and one day master it.... But only 
after I crack the Conways game of life project...  oo
