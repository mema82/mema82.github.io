TIR Day 3

Today was the first day I felt really frustrated with using the Cloud 9 server and debugging what was going 
on with my code becuase I followed all instuction for assingment but since the theme I previously attempted to installed
still had some files in my IDE it was conflicting with my attempts to run a jekyll build. I was nervous about restartign what I had done so had
my github page up but the files were looking diiirrrrrrrrrty!
I also struggled with an error messege which I tried to get help from my classmates with but
could not get suggestions so I went a step further and submitted my issues
onto a forum I use call "Stack Overflow". This issue got me stuck on the project and I was not able to 
move forward :< . On a good note, I was able to really help another classmate today with my notes 
taken from previous class. I was really glad to help someone move forward and hope to learn even 
more in the process.

My "take-away": Don't attempt to do too much too soon. There is always time to go back and
"clean" things up later. Just focus on "gitting 'er done" so at the very least
you have a functional project/page/repo.
