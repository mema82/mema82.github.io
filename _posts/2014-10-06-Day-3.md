Week 3- I see the light!….well, maybe.

This week has been more about learning javascript. I have been working on trying to wrap my head around the syntax and being able to fully grasp all thats been thrown my way. There is so much material that I am learning as well as new tools that are expected to be implemented in my coding immediately so its a bit overwhelming to “master” one while jumping to many others…..if only there was more time in the day :/  I have a full list of tasks to complete and a major refactor of the Conway’s game of life that’s waiting for me so, back to the drawing board!


My weeks struggle: I’m disappointed that I still don’t have a full grasp on the JS language….

Lesson learned: At the end of this week I am able to actually READ and UNDERSTAND what the Javascript code is doing. Writing is fluently is still a hurdle but hey, it’s improvement. Keep at banging on something and you will have a breakthrough, even if only a crack :)
