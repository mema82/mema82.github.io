# Week 2- Github Pages -aka- The start of my future portfolio



Today I learned about creating git pages to use as a professional site for blogging about my Iron Yard expereince!
The page generator was a great start to not having a completely blank site BUT the designer in me really wanted to install a theme.
I spent some time researching themes and decided to go along with a specific one that in the long run gave me issue.
WHY? Because the particular theme I wanted required all this additonal "things" to be installed. It was a learning experience as I
learned that the "things" that needed to be installed were called "gems" and this comes in relation with ruby so from my failed
attempts I was able to learn the these "gems" are like libraries that need to be installed to run certain tasks. I practiced alot
of git commands but unfortunately spend most of my time figuring the theme installation process which overall was a bad way to get stuck.


My "take-away" : Don't get caught up in the "design" aspects of things as a developer because the main focus is to get the task at hand to work properly and meet the requirements that you've set out for it to achieve. Also, don't trust anything that says "simple".
