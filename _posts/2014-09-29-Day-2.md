Title for Blog: Conway's Game of Life 


This week we had an introduction to Node.js and working from the command line as well as working with Cloud 9(IDE) for live coding. I am not a fan of Cloud9 as it depends on internet connection and the connection at The Iron Yard is  constantly kicking everyone off but that give me even more determination to take off the C9 training wheels one day and master the terminal!

The project for this week was using javascript to program a String Calculator, Write Checks and implement a "Simple" version of Conway's Game of Life which is apparently a 3rd year computer science projects and it sure felt that way. Once we put blood, sweat and tears onto our work we were told to refactor everything! 

If these projects are any indication of whats to come... I have to get my armor out now!


My "take-away" : Don't try to bite off more than you can chew. Make sure time is taken to divide elemments up into stages so I can build piece by piece to get a sturdy finished product.
