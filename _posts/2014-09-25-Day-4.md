TIR Day 4 

I ran into alot of issues last night with errors in github which prevented me from moving forward with my project. At this point I decided to
reset all my work and start from scratch. Once I got the hang of creating git pages I then began to rebuild and edit them delete then restart. 
It was great practice and am now confident in creating git pages and setting up clones in the IDE to then create branches of the work to then 
edit and push to github. Where I struggled with the most was not being able to decode the error messeges immediately in github. My "Pomodoro" went
off at 11:30pm and I went to bed but my brain kept running.... I need to learn to relax, take breaks and not get too stressed out because this
is an obstacle that stands in my way preventing me from any clarity. Tommorrow I will start off earlier than usual and be sure to do whatever
it takes to ensure I am on the same page as everyone in my team-- I WILL have PERFECTION!, but not right now.

My "take-away" : Lack of rest to keep on "hacking" is counter productive.
