TIR Day 7

More Javascript (node.js)-The project that we are suppose to produce by the end of week seems nearly impossible. I am still struggling with really KNOWING
the Javascript language. I've but in at least 18 hours per day so far on trying to become comfortable writing the language but I'm still
not where I want to be, or where I feel I 'should' be. I wont let JS win and I will continue to work on embedding the language in my head. 
Dear JS, I'm coming for ya!
